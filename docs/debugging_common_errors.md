# Debugging Common Errors

## Introduction
Debugging is an essential skill for developers. This guide aims to help troubleshoot and resolve common errors encountered in the project. By following this guide, developers can save time and improve the quality of their work.

## Common Errors

### 1. Error: Module Not Found
- **Description**: This error occurs when a required module is missing.
- **Possible Causes**:
  - The module is not installed.
  - Incorrect import path.
- **Resolution**:
  1. Verify the module is listed in `package.json`.
  2. Run `npm install` to install missing dependencies.
  3. Check the import path for typos.

### 2. Error: SyntaxError: Unexpected Token
- **Description**: This error indicates a syntax issue in the code.
- **Possible Causes**:
  - Missing or extra characters (e.g., brackets, commas).
- **Resolution**:
  1. Review the code for syntax errors.
  2. Use a linter to identify issues.

### 3. Error: TypeError: Undefined is not a function

## Best Practices
- Use a debugger to step through the code.
- Add meaningful log statements to track the flow of execution.
- Write unit tests to catch errors early.
- Use tools like ESLint and Prettier to maintain code quality.
- Keep dependencies up to date.
